The code has been organized into a series of folders described below.

## figures
This folder contains code and data for making the figures in the pre-print.

## analysis-code

included in the classifier/ subfolder.

## castools
This folder contains a command-line tool for processing the raw data from a SARGENT experiment.

## tests
